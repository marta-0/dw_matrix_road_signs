# Road signs

This is a third part of the project Matrix - Transformation from DataWorkshop. This part focuses on recognizing road signs.

This part, similarly as the other two parts, lasts 5 days:

* day1 - environment configuration and downloading the data
* [day2](day2_visualisation.ipynb) - visualisations: checking the quality of images and number of occurences
* day3
* day4 
* day5
